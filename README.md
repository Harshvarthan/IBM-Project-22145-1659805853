Industry-specific intelligent fire management systems' main goals are to prevent unintentional fire accidents in industries and to take the necessary precautions to prevent any accidents . To detect any changes in the environment, the smart fire management system has temperature, gas, and flame sensors. The sprinklers will be turned on automatically if any flame is found. The model includes a MQ2 gas sensor for detecting methane and propane gases, an IR flame sensor module for detecting flames, and an LM35 temperature sensor for measuring the surroundings. These readings are recorded in Cloudant DB and continuously monitored by IBM Watson IOT Platform. The exhaust fans are turned on based on the temperature data and whether any gases are present. Through the Fast2SMS web service, the police and fire station will be informed if any deviation takes place. The authorities and the Fire station are notified of emergency alerts.
